### What is Aurelia Mdc Bridge?

Aurelia Mdc Bridge is a collection of wrappers for Material Design Components. You can easy use components and data-bind properties using Aurelia as your client framework.

### What is Aurelia?

[Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) is a JavaScript client framework for mobile, desktop and web leveraging simple conventions and empowering creativity.

### What is Material Components?

[Material Components](https://material.io/components/web/) provide a reliable development environment for apps and websites across Android, iOS, and the web.
